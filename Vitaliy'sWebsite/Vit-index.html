        All students in our web development training program are guided through the process with on-campus career guidance counselors.
        You will work face-to-face with these counselors as you learn web dev, making sure that you have all the tools and
        preparations to be a successful coder.</p>
    <p>
        Our Career Counselors work hard to find jobs that fit and feel right for our students. Students go through mock interviews
        and learn important tips and tricks so they are prepared for their first real interview.
    </p>

        Students get lifetime access to our exclusive Meet nâ€™ Hire events. At these events, students network with employers looking
        for Web Developers.
